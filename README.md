# suedtirolmobilAI

Utilities for normalising responses coming from the SÃ¼dtirol EFA (Elektronische Fahrplanauskunft) backend. The project exposes helper functions that transform raw stop finder and departure monitor payloads into application level Pydantic models.

## Development

The project uses [poetry? no], we use `pyproject.toml` with setuptools. To work on the project create a virtual environment and install the package in editable mode with the development extras:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[dev]
```

## Running the test suite

Recorded fixtures for the EFA backend live under `tests/fixtures`. Tests validate the normalised outputs against the Pydantic schemas and assert contract behaviour for:

- stop finder responses,
- departures versus arrivals monitors,
- realtime delay handling,
- error mapping.

Execute the full suite with:

```bash
pytest
```

## Continuous Integration

A GitHub Actions workflow is provided at `.github/workflows/tests.yml`. It installs the package with development dependencies and runs the `pytest` suite on every push and pull request.
